Verifying Link Ends
===================

As the Fresnel zone is smaller near the transceivers, obstructions near the ends of the link have a greater impact on performance than obstructions near the center of the link.  It is therefore vital to obtain
the most accurate possible survey data at the two ends of the link. The planner needs to answer the following questions:

* Does the path profile (from the Path Profiler) show the correct ground height near the ends of the link path?
* Are there any obstructions near the ends of the link path?
* How high is the antenna?

To obtain approximate answers, use a map and Google Earth(TM): an example is described in :doc:`verifying_a_link_end_using_a_map_and_google_earth`.

To obtain more reliable answers, visit the site and survey the end of the link: an example is described in :doc:`verifying_a_link_end_using_a_survey`.
