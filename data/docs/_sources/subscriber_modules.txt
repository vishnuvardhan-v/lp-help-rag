Subscriber Modules
===================

A Subscriber Module is created when a Subscriber Site location is connected to a Network Device.

The Subscriber Module automatically assumes a number of the Network Device equipment parameters and the choices available at the Subscriber Module are dependent on how the Network Device has been configured.

The Subscriber Module contains the link to the Network Device, including the path profile and performance information.

The Subscriber Module contains the following sections:
