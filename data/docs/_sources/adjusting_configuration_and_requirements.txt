Adjusting Configuration and Requirements (Unlicensed Band)
==========================================================

Adjust the antennas at both ends of the link and confirm that the selected equipment meets the performance requirements:

|note|

        Antenna heights are entered from ground level not from the top of the clutter (if using).
        
        The results shown are using the ITU-R P.530-17 propagation model

1. Adjust the Antenna Heights in the :doc:`Link Page <link_page>` to given values and add Interference Density. Adjust the Interference Density to the required value.

      Adjust Both Ends of Unlicensed Link

2. Insert target values in the :doc:`Performance Summary <performance_summary>` data rate boxes for Mean Throughput Required, Minimum Throughput Required and Minimum Throughput Availability Required.

   Observe that the predicted values are now red because they are less than required values.

3. Select different antennas and change Antenna Heights in the :doc:`Link Page <link_page>`. Adjust User limits if required.

      Adjust Both Ends of Unlicensed Link Again

4. Confirm that the predicted values are no longer red.

 5. Click **Projects** in the top menu bar and then click **Save** |save_project|
 
 |note|
 
        It is not necessary to save the project after each change. Changes
        are automatically stored in the database after clicking Apply. Project
        saving is useful to save a snapshot of the project so that future
        changes can be rolled back using the "Discard Changes" command under the
        "Projects" menu.
