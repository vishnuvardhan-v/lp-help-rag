Adjusting Configuration and Requirements (Licensed Band)
==========================================================

Adjust the paramters at both ends of the link and confirm that the selected equipment meets the performance requirements:

|note|

        Antenna heights are entered from ground level not from the top of the clutter (if using).
        
        The results shown are using the ITU-R P.530-17 propagation model

1. Adjust the Transmit Frequencies, see :ref:`select_transmit_frequencies` to given values and add Interference Density. Adjust the Interference Density to the required value.

      Adjust Both Ends of Licensed Link

2. Insert target values in the :doc:`Performance Summary <performance_summary>` data rate boxes for Mean Throughput Required, Minimum Throughput Required and Minimum Throughput Availability Required.

   Observe that the predicted values are now red because they are less than required values.

      Performance Unacceptable at Both Ends of Licensed Link

3. Change Antenna Heights to give a clear LOS path for licensed band operation in the :doc:`Link Page <link_page>`. Select different antennas and adjust User limits if required.

      Adjust Both Ends of Licensed Link Again

4. Confirm that the predicted values are no longer red.
