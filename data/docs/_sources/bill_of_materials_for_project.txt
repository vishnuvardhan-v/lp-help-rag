The project BOM contains the list of part numbers and associated quantities for the complete project. It includes all the main components required to install the project as configured in LINKPlanner, including antennas, radios, modems (if required), upgrade keys, cabling, lightning protection and GPS sync boxes (if required). It also includes all optional extras, which have been specified at the device or link level, including cables, accessories and spares, Comsearch, installation & mounting, power, security and warranty & support

**P/N**: The Cambium part number. If the component is not supplied by Cambium, this is set to '(no part number)'.

**Description**: Description of the components.

**Qty**: Quantity required.

**Notes**: Displays information about certain items, such as whether they are obsolete.
