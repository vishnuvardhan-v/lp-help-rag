Links
=====

Define the links between sites, obtain profiles of those links and enter link details. The process for each link is:

1. Create a new link by connecting existing sites as described in :doc:`creating_links`. 

2. Display the list of links in the project and open the new link, as  described in :doc:`displaying_link`.                                  

3. Enter the variables that affect performance, such as band, region, equipment, antenna and height. See :doc:`link_page`.
