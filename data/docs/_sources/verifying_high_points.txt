Verifying High Points
=====================

The Google Earth photograph displays high points on the link path as
"Hp1", "Hp2" and so on. These are points at which the link path is very
close to the ground and so prone to obstruction. It is therefore vital to
obtain the most accurate possible survey data at these high points. The
planner needs to answer the following questions:

* Does the path profile (from the Path Profiler) show the correct ground
  height near the high points?
* Are there any obstructions near the high points?

To obtain approximate answers, use a map and Google Earth(TM): an example
is described in :doc:`verifying_a_high_point_using_a_map`.

To obtain more reliable answers, visit and survey the high point: an
example is described in :doc:`verifying_a_high_point_using_a_survey`.
