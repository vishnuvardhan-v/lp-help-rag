Using LINKPlanner
=================

LINKPlanner allows the planner to design PMP networks.


To achieve this goal, follow this process:

1. Start the application and set options. See :doc:`starting_the_application`.
2. Build a project to model a PMP network See :doc:`projects`.
3. Enter details of all sites in the project. See :doc:`sites`.
4. Plan a PMP network, see :doc:`planning_pmp_links`
5. View the Bill of Materials for the project. See :doc:`bill_of_materials_for_project`.
6. Export and report project, network, site and link data. See :doc:`exporting_and_reporting`
