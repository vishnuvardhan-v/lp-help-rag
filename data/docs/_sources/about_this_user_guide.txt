About This User Guide
=======================

The purpose of this user guide is to describe how to access and use Cambium LINKPlanner.

Cambium Networks provides the LINKPlanner application with the following products:

* PTP Planning - 60 GHz cnWave, ePMP (PTP Mode) , PTP 450 family, PTP 670, PTP 700, PTP 820 and PTP 850 equipment
* PMP Planning - cnWave 5G Fixed, 60 GHz cnWave, ePMP, N500, PMP 450 family and HCMP equipment
* cnMatrix Tower Switches


Use LINKPlanner to help predict where and how equipment will work. It allows the network planner to answer
these questions:

* Will each link transmit data fast enough for the user?
* Will each link be reliable enough for the user?
* Which Network Device will be best for a subscriber?
