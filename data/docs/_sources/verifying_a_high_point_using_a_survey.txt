Verifying a High Point Using a Survey
=====================================

This is an example to show how Cambium link planners use a high point
survey to refine their estimates of the terrain and obstructions near
high points. This builds on the previous example
:doc:`verifying_a_high_point_using_a_map`.

We use the following survey aids:

* Map, path profile, Google Earth(TM) aerial photo
* Barometric GPS receiver
* Clear plastic ruler
* Surveyor's tape measure
* Pocket calculator
* Binoculars

We follow these steps:

1. We use the barometric GPS receiver to verify terrain height. 

   Because air pressure may change frequently, the GPS receiver must
   be recalibrated near every high point, at a point with a known
   altitude. The map shows a suitable point for calibration, where the
   road crosses the 150 m contour near the high point, as annotated on
   this Google Earth photograph:

   .. figure:: gps_calibration_point_near_hp1.jpg

      GPS Calibration Point near Hp1

   We calibrate the GPS at this point.

2. We go to the high point (or as near to it as possible) and record  
   the terrain height from the GPS: 156 m.                             

3. We go to a place where we can observe the trees from a measured    
   (or estimated) distance.                                           

   We estimate the height of the highest trees in the clump using the
   ruler method, as described in
   :doc:`verifying_a_link_end_using_a_survey`. We record the height of
   the highest trees: 20 m. We also record the height of the trees at
   the edge of the clump: 15 m.

4. When we return to the office, we update the profile with these     
   results, adjusting the clutter type to Deciduous Forest at 15 m with a slight adjustment in the terrain height and on the outer edge setting the clutter to Light Trees - Shrubs at 5 m with an additional obstruction loss of m.

We now have a more accurate profile of the high point. This will help us
to optimize the link and achieve acceptable data throughput.
