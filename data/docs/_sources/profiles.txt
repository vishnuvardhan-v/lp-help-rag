Profiles
=========

Profiles are a visualization of the path between two end points, e.g. between a Network Device and a Subscriber Module for a PMP link. Profiles are automatically populated into the link as soon as it is created.

Profiles can be requested with or without the clutter information. To request the clutter information tick the **Use Clutter?** option in **Project Properties**, to request only the terrain profile untick the **Use Clutter?** option, see :doc:`project_page`.

Once a profile is available it can be modified to allow for local obstructions and correct any terrain heights or clutter types if necessary, see :doc:`adjusting_link_profiles` and :doc:`link_profile_adjustment_examples` .
