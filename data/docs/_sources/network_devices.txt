PMP Network Devices
===================

The Network Device connects to one or more Subscriber Sites to create links to Subscriber Modules. 


Creating Network Devices
--------------------------

To create a new Network Device from the map view, click |new_nd_device|  on the right panel  of the project window. This opens the Network Device Mode window. 

.. _New_Network_Device_Mode:
.. figure:: New_Network_Device_Mode.png

   New Network Device Mode

To use the height of an existing network site, tick **Use the site Maximum Height**? For new sites or to override the network site height leave this box unticked and set the required height. Set the Range Units and SM Range to configure the furthest point at which SMs can connect to the Network Device.

To add a network device to an existing site, click on the site. Multiple network devices can be added to the same site, they will be separated by the beamwidth of the antenna or the Modeled Beamwidth if it has been set to a different value.

To create multiple Network Devices Click |icon_pmp_nd| OR |menu_pmp_nd| in the left panel of the page.

This displays the PMP Tables page. Click on the **Network Devices** tab.

Click |icon_add_extend| to create new PMP Network Devices

This displays the :ref:`Create_Select_Template` page.

Select **New equipment configuration** and click |icon_next| to create a first template or select **Use previous configuration** to choose from an existing template. If there are existing Network Devices, then the **Configure from existing end** option will also be available.

.. _Create_Select_Template:

Calculating Tilt Angle
----------------------

To calculate the optimum tilt angle for a Network Device (the mechanical tilt required to give maximum throughput) select the **Calc Tilt** |calc_tilt_button| option to display the :ref:`calc_tilt_dialog`. 

  |note|
  
        Attach all the required subscriber modules to the Network Device before running this command. 

.. _calc_tilt_dialog:
.. figure:: calc_tilt_dialog.png

   Calculate Tilt Dialog

The dialog shows a number of options:

  **Min Tilt**: Set the minimum tilt angle to consider when running the calculations. The default is the minimum downtilt of the antenna.

  **Max Tilt**: Set the maximum tilt angle to consider when running the calculations. The default is the maximum uptilt of the antenna.
  
  **Interval**: Set the step interval to define the intermediate tilt angles in the results list. Use a large value if the difference between the Minimum and Maximum is large, reduce the interval for smaller ranges.
  
  **Calculate**: Start the calculation.
  
  **Cancel**: Cancel the calculation from running.
  
  **Apply Tilt**: Apply the selected tilt angle to the network device. The network device will not update unless this command is executed.
  
When the calculation has finished running, the results are shown below the configuration settings. The angle that offers the maximum throughput has its radio button activated and is automatically selected. If multiple angles offer the same throughput then the middle angle is selected. To use a different angle, select the radio button next to the required row. Select **Apply Tilt** to update the Network Device to the new tilt angle.

Bill of Materials for PMP Network Device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LINKPlanner automatically calculates the Bill of Materials (BOM) for the required components of the Network Device. The Network Device BOM contains the list of part numbers and associated quantities. To add additional items to the BOM, click |new_extra|. A list of optional extras for the Network Device will be displayed. To add items to the BOM tick the box next to each item required and click **OK**. The item will appear in the main list, where the quantity can be adjusted by selecting the number in the **Qty** column and adjusting as required. To delete optional items from the BOM list, tick the box next to each item and click |delete_extra|. A star denotes optional extras which have been added to the automatic BOM items. To power the Network Device from the switch tick the **Power from switch?** box. 

When Power from switch is selected, where possible the PoE and line cord are removed from the BOM, which may result in the kit part number changing to a different kit that doesn't include a PoE. This is not available for all products and country variants.

|note| 

        The **Power from Switch** option is only available if the network site has a switch attached to it, see :doc:`adding_switches` and the product selected can be powered by the switch, which includes most of the PoE powered Cambium radios.

|note| 

        If TX2000 is the Sync option on PTP 670 HCMP/PTP 700 HCMP the Network Device will automatically be configured to be powered from the switch.
