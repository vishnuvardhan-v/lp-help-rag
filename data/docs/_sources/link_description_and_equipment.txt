   PTP Product Configuration (unlicensed bands)
   
|note|

        Some parameters are required when configuring the product but are currently not used in the LINKPlanner calculations, they will be used in future releases. These items are identified as "(information only)" in the descriptions below.
   
**Product Configuration Parameters**

  **Bandwidth**: Select the channel bandwidth.
  
  **E1/T1**: (PTP 670 and PTP 700 only). If the link is to carry telecoms traffic, select the number of E1 or T1 links required. For more information, see :doc:`optimizing_e1_or_t1_latency`.

  **Optimization**: (PTP 670 and PTP 700 only). Select the optimization for the link, either for IP Traffic or TDM Traffic. If TDM is enabled, the link is optimized automatically for TDM traffic/latency.

  **Sync**: (PTP 670 and PTP 700 only). Defaults to Disabled. TDD Synchronization will be added in a future release

  **Symmetry**: (PTP  670 and PTP 700 only). Select the link operation (Adaptive, Symmetric, 2:1, 3:1 or 5:1 - options are dependent on Product and other configuration settings).
  
  **Dual Payload**: (PTP 670 and PTP 700 only). Allow dual-payload modulation modes for better throughput.
  
  **Highest Mod Mode**: (PTP 670 and PTP 700 only). Select the highest modulation mode for the Ethernet traffic to limit the maximum throughput rate, default is 256 QAM 0.81 (no limit). Dual or Single will be automatically selected depending on the setting for **Dual Payload**.
 
  **Maximum Mod Mode**: (ePMP, PTP Mode or PTP 450 family only). Select the highest modulation mode for the Ethernet traffic to limit the maximum throughput rate, default for ePMP 11n is MCS15 and 11ac is MCS 9 (256QAM 0.83 Dual).
  
  **Minimum Mod Mode**: (PTP 450 family only) Select the lowest modulation mode for the traffic. 
  
  **Lowest Ethernet Mode** (PTP 670 and PTP 700 only). Select the lowest modulation mode for the Ethernet traffic to achieve the required throughput rate, default is BPSK 0.63 Single.

  **Lowest Telecoms Mode** (PTP 670 and PTP 700 only). When a link is configured for E1 or T1 telecoms traffic, select the lowest modulation mode to achieve the required latency. For more information, see :doc:`optimizing_e1_or_t1_latency`.
  
  **Color Code**: (PTP 450 and 450i only). Select the Color Code for the link (information only).
  
  **Frame Period**: (PTP 450 and 450i only). Select the Frame Period.
  
  **Downlink Data**: (PTP 450 and 450i only). Set the proportion of the link to be used for throughput from the Master to the Slave.
  
  **DL/UL Ratio**: (ePMP only). Select the required DL/UL Ratio, where DL is the proportion of the link to be used for throughput from the Master to the Slave.
  
  **Master**: Select which site is the master.
  
  **Gb Ethernet Port**: (ePMP 1000 only). Select whether each end of the link requires equipment with a GbE port instead of an FE port (the FE port will limit the maximum throughput if selected at either end of the link). Select Gb Ethernet Port at the Master if the link has to be synchronized.
