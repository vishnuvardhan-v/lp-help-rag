Quick Tutorial - PTP Licensed Band
====================================

This section is a quick tutorial to plan a simple PTP link. It describes how to create a project to analyze the performance of a single
PTP link operating in a licensed frequency band (above 6 GHz) between two sites. For 60 GHz please see :doc:`quick_tutorial`.

Before starting this tutorial, complete the following steps:

1. Login to LINKPlanner, see :doc:`starting_the_application`.
2. Enter the correct details in the Preferences page. See :doc:`preferences`.

There are two parts to this tutorial:

1. Create a project with two sites and one link. See :doc:`creating_project_sites_and_link_licensed`.
2. Adjust the antennas at both ends of the link and confirm that the selected equipment meets the performance requirements. See :doc:`adjusting_configuration_and_requirements_licensed`.
