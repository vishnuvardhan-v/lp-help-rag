Adjusting Link Profiles
=======================

Link planners need to verify and adjust link profiles for the following
reasons:

* To enter accurate estimates of antenna heights.
* To correct the average terrain heights provided by the Path Profiler.
* To verify the clutter type (if used) provided by the Path Profiler 
* To allow for obstructions in the link path (usually trees) when working without clutter.
* To add additional height to clutter where the default height is not sufficient for the local area.
* To allow for the effect of reflection when the link path is over water.

The process for each link is:

1. View the link in the Google Earth(TM) aerial photograph (if it is available), as described in :doc:`using_google_earth`.                 

2. Obtain the most accurate possible data at the two ends of the link, as described in :doc:`verifying_link_ends`.                      

3. Obtain the most accurate possible data at the high points, as described in :doc:`verifying_high_points`.                             

4. Update the profiles as described in :doc:`updating_link_profiles`. 

For examples of how Cambium link planners use a map, Google Earth and surveys to adjust link profiles, see :doc:`link_profile_adjustment_examples`.
