Profile
=======

This section contains a visualization of the path between the Network Device and the Subscriber Module 
(:ref:`sm_profile_with_trees`).

In this example, there are some higher buildings in the dense suburban section, that give an additional 7 m obstruction at 0.7 km and and 4.0 m obstruction at 0.846 km, which enter the Fresnel zone and alter the slope.

   PMP Profile with Clutter and Obstructions

Color code used in the profile:

* Brown: terrain.
* Colored blocks: clutter, see :doc:`project_page` for default colors per clutter type
* Yellow: obstructions (such as trees or buildings), these can either be above ground level or above the clutter height.
* Red: line of site from the antennas to the largest obstruction (called "slope").
* Blue: the Fresnel zone.
* Grey: the profile worst case which occurs up to 0.1% of the time. Sometimes known as Worst Earth curvature (Ke). (This line will only be shown on longer links).

To update the profile to allow for terrain height, clutter type and obstructions, see :doc:`adjusting_link_profiles`.

The Fresnel zone shown is a visualization of 0.6F\ :sub:`1`\, which is shown for guidance when setting antenna heights for path clearance (When clutter is not enabled a visualization of F\ :sub:`0.6`\  or 0.78F\ :sub:`1`\  is shown). It is not used directly in the diffraction loss calculations.
