Planning PTP links
==================

The goal of PTP link planning is to ensure that each direction of the link will perform to an acceptable level, measured by the Throughput and Availability values in the :doc:`performance_summary` section of the :doc:`link_page`. To allow LINKPlanner to predict Throughput and Availability, the planner must enter the variables that affect link performance, such as: band, region, equipment, antenna, height, terrain, obstructions and reflection.

To achieve this goal, follow this process:

1. Start the application and set options. See :doc:`starting_the_application`.
2. Build a project to model a PTP link (or network). See :doc:`projects`.
3. Enter details of all sites in the project. See :doc:`sites`.
4. Define the links between sites. See :doc:`links`.
5. Confirm that the link will perform to an acceptable level, measured by the Throughput and Availability values in the
   :doc:`performance_summary` section of the :doc:`link_page`.
6. Export and report project, site and link data. See :doc:`exporting_and_reporting`
