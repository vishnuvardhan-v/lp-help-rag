Bill of Materials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LINKPlanner automatically calculates the Bill of Materials (BOM) for the required components of the switch. The switch BOM contains the list of part numbers, descriptions and associated quantities for the switch. Optional items can be added to the list. The link BOM can be saved as a CSV or Excel file by clicking |table_download_csv| in the menu options. 

**P/N**: The Cambium part number. If the component is not supplied by Cambium, this is set to '(no part number)'.

**Description**: Description of the components.

**Qty**: Quantity required. 

**Notes**: By default this displays information about certain items, such as whether they are obsolete.

To add additional items to the BOM, click |new_extra|. A list of optional extras for the link will be displayed. To filter the list of optional extras, enter a part number or description in the Filter field. To add items to the BOM tick the box next to each item required and click **OK**. The item will appear in the main list, where the quantity can be adjusted by selecting the number in the **Qty** column and adjusting as required. To delete optional items from the BOM list, tick the box next to each item and click |delete_extra|. A star denotes optional extras which have been added to the automatic BOM items.
