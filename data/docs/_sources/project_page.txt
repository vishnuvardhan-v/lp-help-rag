   single: Use Clutter

Project Properties
-------------------

Set the prediction model that is used to calculate the link availability (see :doc:`availability`) and tick "Use Clutter" to include clutter data with the path profiles, untick to work without clutter information. These parameters are stored with the project.


|note|
    
    When changing between working with or without clutter this changes the way that obstructions are portrayed and the version of ITU-R P.526 that is used to calculate obstruction loss. Changing an existing project to use clutter will change the obstruction loss predicted on paths within the project.

        A project must be saved before other users can see it. Those with share permissions will see the latest saved version of the project file. When a shared project is opened by another user their version is read only |read_only| unless they save it locally as a new project.
