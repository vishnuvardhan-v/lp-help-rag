Advanced Features
=====================

The Advanced Features node of the navigation tree contains the following:
   

* **Antennas**: This feature displays tables of available antennas. It is possible to create, edit and delete custom antennas for Unlicensed PTP and Subscriber Modules. See :doc:`antennas`. 

* **Best Server Analysis**: Automatically determine which ND is the best option for all subscriber sites. This requires the PMP Network Device to be created prior to running. See :doc:`best_server_analysis`. 

* **Terragraph Planner**:  This feature only applies to cnWave 60 GHz products. Use the Terragraph Planner feature to automatically plan a 60 GHz Network. The Terragraph Planner automatically selects the most appropriate DN locations, assigns the orientation of the DN and if required connects the CNs to each DN. See :doc:`terragraph_planner`.
