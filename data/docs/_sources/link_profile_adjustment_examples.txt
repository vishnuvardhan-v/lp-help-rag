Link Profile Adjustment Examples
================================

These examples show how Cambium link planners use a map, Google Earth and surveys to adjust link profiles.

The original path profile for the point-to-point link from Addislade Farm to Yelland Cross Farm is built using the Path Profiler data where the clutter along the path is all set to Rural with 0 m height:

We verify the link ends and the high points as described in the following
examples:

* :doc:`verifying_a_link_end_using_a_map_and_google_earth`
* :doc:`verifying_a_link_end_using_a_survey`
* :doc:`verifying_a_high_point_using_a_map`
* :doc:`verifying_a_high_point_using_a_survey`

These methods are applied to both link ends and to all high points in the
link path. The resulting path profile is shown here:
