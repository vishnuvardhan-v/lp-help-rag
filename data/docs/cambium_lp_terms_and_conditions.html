The Receiving Party shall, at all times, both during the Term and thereafter, keep in confidence and trust all of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information received by it. The Receiving Party shall not use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party other than as necessary to fulfill the Receiving Party’s obligations or to exercise the Receiving Party’s rights under these Terms. Each party agrees to secure and protect the other party’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care and in a manner consistent with the maintenance of such party’s own Confidential Information (but in no event less than reasonable care), and to take appropriate action by instruction or agreement with its employees or other agents who are permitted access to the other party’s Confidential Information to satisfy its obligations under this Section. The Receiving Party shall not disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any person or entity other than its officers, employees and agents who need access to such Confidential Information in order to effect the intent of these Terms and who are subject to confidentiality obligations at least as stringent as the obligations set forth in these Terms.</p>
<p>9.3 <strong>Exceptions to Confidential Information.</strong> The obligations set forth in Section 9.2 (Non-Disclosure) shall not apply to the extent that Confidential Information includes information which: (a) was known by the Receiving Party prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party either itself or through receipt directly or indirectly from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; (b) was developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; or (c) becomes publicly known or otherwise ceases to be secret or confidential, except as a result of a breach of these Terms or any obligation of confidentiality by the Receiving Party. Nothing in these Terms shall prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing Confidential Information to the extent the Receiving Party is legally compelled to do so by any governmental investigative or judicial agency pursuant to proceedings over which such agency has jurisdiction; provided, however, that prior to any such disclosure, the Receiving Party shall (x) assert the confidential nature of the Confidential Information to the agency; (y) immediately notify the Disclosing Party in writing of the agency’s order or request to disclose; and (z) cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party in protecting against any such disclosure and in obtaining a protective order narrowing the scope of the compelled disclosure and protecting its confidentiality.</p>
<p>9.4 <strong>Injunctive Relief.</strong> The Parties agree that any unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information may cause immediate and irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party and that, in the event of such breach, the Receiving Party will be entitled, in addition to any other available remedies, to seek immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without bond and without the necessity of showing actual monetary damages.</p>
